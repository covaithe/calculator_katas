EDIT:  Now this is the refactored version, using a strategy pattern.  Pretty nice. 
the refactoring went smoothly. 

This is a straightforward Parser based implementation, using test generation macros
in the tests.  I've done this a few times now and it went smoothly.  

I'm mostly doing this so that I can use this as a base for trying to refactor into
a strategy pattern.
