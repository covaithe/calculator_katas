This is my first pass at implementing this thing with a strategy pattern 
instead of the usual conditionals.  It went okay, but felt a little clumsy
in implementation.  I skipped a few steps that didn't feel central to the 
strategy idea, and I didn't get all the way to multiple long delimiters due to 
lack of time.  Still, I think the idea is generally sound.  

Directions to go from here:
* refactor early:  this is basically what I tried here, and I want more practice.
* refactor late.  I think I could get all the way through a normal parser impl
  and only refactor to this at the very end.  Not sure it's the best idea, but 
  it's something that often happens in real life, so might be good to practice. 
* build directly to this pattern with interface tests.  Seems ambitious, but worth trying
